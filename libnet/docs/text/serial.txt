Serial Driver
==============

General
--------

  Select serials ports that you want Libnet to use in `libnet.cfg'.
  For example:

	[serial]
	autoports = 0 1

  will selected ports 0 and 1 (COM1 and COM2 to DOS people). These
  will be opened automatically when you initialise the serial
  driver.

  The address format is `X:Y' where `X' is the physical port and
  `Y' is the virtual port.  The following bindings are possible:

	NULL - any virtual port on all physical ports
	""   - default virtual port on all physical ports
	X:Y  - virtual port Y on physical port X
	:Y   - virtual port Y on all physical ports
	X    - default virtual port on physical port X

Configuration
--------------

  There can be a separate section for each port, like so:

	[serial port 0]
	baudrate = 115200
	bits = 8
	stopbits = 1
	parity = none
	baseaddr = 0x3f8	(DOS only)
	irq = 4			(DOS only)

  But you shouldn't have to touch any of this.  The options are
  only included for completeness -- they may not work.

Troubleshooting
----------------

DOS:

  Check you have not altered the default IRQ numbers in your BIOS
  settings.  If necessary, you can use the config stuff shown above.
 
Linux:

  Check that you have read-write permissions to /dev/ttySx, and make
  sure that GPM isn't reading data from the port.

BeOS:

  `chat' and `rdmchat' won't compile under BeOS, yet.

  Bug: sometimes `rdmtest' will queue up packets under BeOS.
       (has not been tested under new serial driver)
