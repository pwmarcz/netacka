1. Driver-Section Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This index shows which sections are used by each driver.

    a) Windows sockets: (a) [sockets], (b) [winsock]
    b) Berkeley sockets: (a) [sockets]


2. Section Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    a) [sockets]
    """"""""""""
        Relevant to:  Windows sockets, Berkeley sockets

        This section is shared between the drivers that use 
        sockets to communicate over the internet, so that they
        can communicate with one another easily.

        port = <port number>                default: 24785
        
            A 16-bit port number to use as a default port.  A 
            newly created "input" channel's socket is bound to
            this port, and ordinary channels are assigned this
            port on target machines when no other port is 
            specified.
        
        
        forceport = 0 or 1                  default: 0

            This tells the interface what to do if, when 
            creating an input channel, it cannot bind to the 
            port.  If this is 0, it simply gives up; if it is 1
            the driver will attempt to use the port despite the
            fact that it's already occupied.
        
        
        ip = <ip address>                   default: 0.0.0.0
        
            If specified, this is used as the local IP address.
            If you don't specify this but do specify a nameserver
            and the `auto_get_ip' flag is set in the [Winsock] 
            section, the Winsock driver will attempt to determine
            the local IP address using the nameserver.  At 
            present the Berkeley sockets driver can't get the 
            local IP address (other than through this setting).
            It's not crucial, just aesthetic.
        
        
    b) [winsock]
    """"""""""""
        Relevant to:  Windows sockets

        Most of these are really just hacks to things the 
        driver ought to be able to find out by itself, but the
        VxD doesn't provide the information.

        nameserver = <ip address>           default: none
        
            There can be any number of these but only the first
            MAX_NAMESERVERS (#defined to 4 in wsock.c) are used.
            These nameservers will be queried when addresses are
            given in hostname format.
        
        
        dns_timeout = <time>                default: 10
        
            This is the maximum length of time (in seconds) that
            the driver will spend trying to resolve a hostname.
            If the value is too short some addresses may not get
            resolved in time.
        
        
        auto_get_ip = 0 or 1                default: 0
        
            If this flag is set, a nameserver is given and the 
            IP address is either not given or is 0.0.0.0, the 
            Winsock driver will attempt to find out an IP 
            address for this machine by establishing a TCP/IP
            connection with a nameserver (it tries each in turn)
            and querying the local address of the socket.
