Notes on Libnet documentation
=============================

In this directory you'll find documentation in various formats
-- plain text, info, HTML and Texinfo source.  If you have
various required tools (notably makeinfo, texi2html and sed)
then you can rebuild them by typing `make' here.  The normal
build process doesn't do this though, in case people don't have
the tools.

Some of the documentation is not yet in Texinfo format.  You can
find this in the `text' subdirectory.  Be warned that some of it 
is rather old and needs updating.  Most of it should be correct
though.

If there are any queries about this documentation (in
particular, mistakes or inadequacies) please do discuss them
with me, either personally or through the netgame mailing list.

You can also browse the HTML documentation online:
