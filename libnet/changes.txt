This file describes the changes between versions of Libnet.



0.10.11: released 18/02/2003
   *  Jörg Rüppel and George Foot fixed various problems the conns.
   *  Adam J. Richter fixed a piece of code that gcc 3 didn't like.


0.10.10: released 11/11/2001
   *  Not sure what has changed at the moment, this is a quick release
	to fix the DOS version which was apparently broken in 0.10.9.


0.10.9: released 07/06/2001
   *  Ben Davis rewrote the serial driver, making it work much better
   *  George Foot added a conio-Allegro wrapper to the examples, which
	could make them easier to build for Windows
   *  George Foot added net_prepare_address for DNS lookups
   *  I'm sure other things have changed in the past year, but I've 
	forgotten what -- please email me (gfoot@users.sf.net) if you know
	of something I've forgotten


0.10.8: released 09/05/2000
   *  Fixed the documentation, and expanded the system to support DVI and
	PostScript output
   *  Peter Wang corrected a bug in `lib/drivers/local.c'
   *  Fixed various mistakes preventing the library from building in MSVC
   *  Prevented `serbeos.cpp' from being built on non-BeOS platforms, to
	avoid having to require a C++ compiler on other platforms


0.10.7: released 07/05/2000
   *  Made much of the code thread-safe.  See `docs/text/thr_*.txt'.
   *  Added `net_set_mutex_funcs' and `net_set_timer_func', changing
	the way `__libnet_timer_func' works.
   *  Peter Wang reorganised the serial code, adding drivers for Linux 
	and BeOS.
   *  Made `net_initdriver' take a copy of its parameter, in case it 
	gets clobbered by the new call to `net_detectdriver'.
   *  Added an ID to each connection request.


0.10.6: released 19/03/2000
   *  Fixed bug in lib/core/connhelp.c -- `poll' was allocating a 64k 
	array on the stack!
   *  Modified wsockdos.c to support compilation with gcc 2.9.5 for DOS
   *  Peter Wang rewrote the local host driver, since it wasn't working
	with conns
   *  Peter also added `net_detectdriver' and `net_initdriver', which
	work on individual drivers rather than lists of drivers...
   *  ... and wrote some functions to help people make new links in 
	parallel to existing ones, along with a test program...
   *  ... and made some modifications to the conio emulation
   *  The `net_connect_wait*_time' functions were using `sleep', which
	(in Linux) doesn't mix well with Allegro
   *  Added functions to return the driver ID a conn or channel is using
   *  Made initialising an undetected driver first try to detect it 
	(the old behaviour was just to ignore the driver)
   *  Added network classes
   *  Disabled the code to deal with duplicated connection attempts from
	a single client, because it's not right and it's safer without 
	it for now -- maybe we'll put it back in if/when it can be 
	fixed; I'm sceptical.


0.10.5 (revised): released 06/02/2000
   *  Fixed silly typo in MSVC library building batch file

0.10.5: released 03/02/2000
   *  Modified wsockdos.h to support compilation with gcc 2.9.5 for DOS
   *  Ported to Mingw32 and MSVC
   *  Created a batch file build system, as an alternative to makefiles
   *  Made various text files' dates (e.g. this one's) Y2K compliant


0.10.4: released 21/11/1999
   *  Corrected the mistake in lib/drivers/local.c


0.10.3: released 04/04/1999
   *  *Really* fixed the conn system now!
   *  Added a new example -- rdmchat, the same chat system but using 
        conns instead of channels.  Much nicer.
   *  Fixed minor bugs in various places
   *  Removed the examples from the RSXNTDJ build, because it can't
        build them yet
   *  Merged in the serial driver (thanks to Peter Wang)
   *  Renamed various things to be more consistent
   *  Updated the makefile's dependency information
   *  Added a mechanism for configuring the conn system
   *  Changed the way the IPX driver enables the nearptr hack
   *  Added some new conn functions and documented some existing
        undocumented ones -- these are net_ignore_rdm, net_conn_stats
        and net_getpeer.
   *  Indexed a lot of the documentation (Texinfo is so cool!)
   *  Changed the IPX driver's separator between network and machine
        addresses to `/'
   *  Made all drivers recognise the `disable' config option, and not
        be detected if it's set


0.10.2: released 01/04/1999
   *  Added two new drivers (thanks to Ralph Deane) -- IPX and Local
        Host
   *  Fixed the RDM system -- connections work now
   *  Tidied up some of the exported symbols


0.10.1: released 27/02/1999
   *  Finished the RDM system, but it doesn't work
   *  Added a new test program for the RDM system
   *  Made the chat program work in more environments
   *  Made miscellaneous documentation updates


0.10.0: released 26/01/1999

   *  Made it portable to lots of other operating systems
   *  Moved most of the docs to Texinfo format, producing versions 
        in plain text, info format and HTML
   *  Added some of the RDM system
   *  Put the HTML format documentation online


0.9.13: never released

   *  Made some things in wsock.c static
   *  Fixed important bug in wsock.c -- thanks to Chris Frolick, who
        persevered and learned to use several debuggers while 
        searching for this bug


0.9.12: released 05/03/1998

   *  Fixed makefiles which were broken under djgpp in several ways
   *  Corrected prototype for net_getdrivernames in docs
   *  Renamed the fake stricmp in core/config.c
   *  Added missing `#endif' to examples/chat/_coniox.c (FWIW)
   *  Made version numbering consistent
   *  Added own IP detection to the Winsock driver


0.9.11: released 24/01/1998

   *  Ported to Linux and other Unixes
   *  Added Berkeley sockets driver for Unixes
   *  Added changes.txt file, so anything below this point was written 
        retrospectively
   *  Fixed ` = { 0 }' bug which was crashing the socks driver
   *  Moved chat client/server test to `examples' directory
   *  Fiddled with config settings to allow socks driver and wsock driver
        to share the default port and force option


0.9.10: released 21/01/1998

   *  Added DNS resolver to Winsock driver
   *  Added the configuration file system
   *  Improved openinputchannel using the config file
   *  Modified Winsock driver to use various config settings
   *  Updated documentation

   *  Core features:
        init, detectdrivers, getdrivernames, initdrivers, shutdown
   *  Basic channel support:
        openchannel, openinputchannel (hackishly), closechannel,
        assigntarget, getlocaladdress, send, receive, query
   *  Drivers:

   *  Test programs:
        getdrvnm, gentest, chat
   *  Documentation nearly up-to-date
